**Task 1**

**Employee-Salary-Prediction**

**Objective:**

Your task is to build a machine learning model that predicts the base salary of employees using the provided dataset. You are expected to perform data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation within a day.

**Data Exploration:**

Recognize the properties and structure of the dataset Use fundamental statistical analysis to pinpoint the data's salient features. univarient, bivarient & multivarient analysis of data set. i got meaningful insights from analysis histogramplot - how to distribute the each variable from the dataset. it will help to identify its normally distributed or not. heatmap - how much strength have in the each variable compared to others, [division & deprtment has been highly correlated from the dataset] boxplot - to identified the outlier [base_salary, overtime_pay, longvity_pay] these coloumns are contains outliers

**Data Preprocessing:**

Handle missing values - using fillna method to fill the missing values. handle outliers - using capping method for changing to outliers value to corrected values. Encode categorical variables - label encoding method will be used into catorical values to numerical values. Split the data - Split the data into training and testing sets.

**Feature Engineering:**

Identify the features [Base_Salary] that might improve model performance.

**Model Building:**

Work with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.). igot more accuracy in linear regression model compared with other models.

Linear Regression MSE: 0.009511914910418967, R²: 0.9999994362016347 Decision Tree MSE: 6350.427786748267, R²: 0.6235920065402036 Random Forest MSE: 2621.793155098221, R²: 0.8445988311470158 Gradient Boosting MSE: 1234.752982660588, R²: 0.9268126639292507


**TASK 2**

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation With Langchain Report**

**Components of RAG with LangChain and OpenAI**


**Document Retrieval System**

1.	Indexing and Search: Use an indexing system (e.g., FAISS) to index your documents or knowledge base. This allows efficient retrieval of relevant documents based on queries.
2.	LangChain Integration: Integrate the retrieval system with LangChain, allowing for easy querying and management of the documents.

**Generative Model**

1.	OpenAI API: Use OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 model as the generative component. You can access this through the OpenAI API using your API key.
2.	Prompt Engineering: Craft prompts that effectively utilize the retrieved information to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.
   
**Workflow**

1.	Query Handling: When a query is received, use LangChain to first retrieve relevant documents or information.
2.	Contextual Generation: Feed the retrieved information into the generative model via the OpenAI API. Use the information to guide the model's output, ensuring that responses are accurate and relevant.
3.	Response Generation: The system outputs a response that combines the retrieved information with the generative model's capabilities.

**Implementation Details**

**Setting Up LangChain and OpenAI API**

1.	LangChain Installation: Install LangChain and any necessary dependencies.
    -	pip install langchain
2.	OpenAI API Key: Set up your OpenAI API key in your environment or code to access the OpenAI models.

**Building the RAG Pipeline**

**Document Retrieval:**

o	Index your documents using a retrieval system.
o	Use LangChain to integrate and query this system.

**Generative Response:**

o	Use the retrieved documents to craft prompts.
o	Send these prompts to the OpenAI API and get the generated response.

**Handling Responses:**

o	Process and format the response as needed for your application.
