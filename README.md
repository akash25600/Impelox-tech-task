**Task 1**

**Employee-Salary-Prediction**

**üéØ Objective:**

Build a machine learning model to predict employee base salaries using the provided dataset. The goal is to perform data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

**üìä Data Exploration:**

Gain insights into the dataset by performing,

**Statistical Analysis:**   Uncover key features through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

**Visualizations:**
**Histogram:**   Understand the distribution of each variable and identify if they are normally distributed.
**Heatmap:**     Measure the strength of relationships between variables, highlighting highly correlated features like Division and Department.
**Boxplot:**     Detect outliers in columns such as Base_Salary, Overtime_Pay, and Longevity_Pay.

**üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing:**

Prepare the dataset for model training using the following steps,

**Handling Missing Values:**   Utilize pandas' fillna method to fill missing values.
**Addressing Outliers:**    Apply capping methods to correct outlier values.
**Encoding Categorical Variables: **  Convert categorical values to numerical format using sklearn's LabelEncoder.
**Data Splitting:**    Split the dataset into training and testing sets with sklearn's train_test_split.

**üîç Feature Engineering:**

Engineer features to enhance model performance, focusing on [Base_Salary] and other relevant features, for improve our model performance.

**üß© Model Building:**

Experiment with various machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model,

**Linear Regression:**   Achieved the highest accuracy with sklearn's LinearRegression.

MSE: 0.0095
R¬≤: 0.9999

**Decision Tree:**   Implemented using sklearn's DecisionTreeRegressor.

MSE: 6350.4278
R¬≤: 0.6236

**Random Forest:**   Applied using sklearn's RandomForestRegressor.

MSE: 2621.7932
R¬≤: 0.8446

**Gradient Boosting:**   Utilized sklearn's GradientBoostingRegressor.
MSE: 1234.7530
R¬≤: 0.9268

Linear regression got accuracy compared to other model perfomance.

**TASK 2**

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation With Langchain Report**

**Components of RAG with LangChain and OpenAI**


**Document Retrieval System**

1.	Indexing and Search: Use an indexing system (e.g., FAISS) to index your documents or knowledge base. This allows efficient retrieval of relevant documents based on queries.
2.	LangChain Integration: Integrate the retrieval system with LangChain, allowing for easy querying and management of the documents.

**Generative Model**

1.	OpenAI API: Use OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 model as the generative component. You can access this through the OpenAI API using your API key.
2.	Prompt Engineering: Craft prompts that effectively utilize the retrieved information to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.
   
**Workflow**

1.	Query Handling: When a query is received, use LangChain to first retrieve relevant documents or information.
2.	Contextual Generation: Feed the retrieved information into the generative model via the OpenAI API. Use the information to guide the model's output, ensuring that responses are accurate and relevant.
3.	Response Generation: The system outputs a response that combines the retrieved information with the generative model's capabilities.

**Implementation Details**

**Setting Up LangChain and OpenAI API**

1.	LangChain Installation: Install LangChain and any necessary dependencies.
    -	pip install langchain
2.	OpenAI API Key: Set up your OpenAI API key in your environment or code to access the OpenAI models.

**Building the RAG Pipeline**

**Document Retrieval:**

o	Index your documents using a retrieval system.
o	Use LangChain to integrate and query this system.

**Generative Response:**

o	Use the retrieved documents to craft prompts.
o	Send these prompts to the OpenAI API and get the generated response.

**Handling Responses:**

o	Process and format the response as needed for your application.
