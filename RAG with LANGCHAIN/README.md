**TASK 2**

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation With Langchain**

**🌟 Components of RAG with LangChain and OpenAI**


**🗂️ Document Retrieval System**

Indexing and Search,

**Tool:**   FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

**Purpose:**   Efficiently index your documents or knowledge base to enable quick retrieval based on queries.

LangChain Integration,

**Functionality:**   Seamlessly integrate the retrieval system with LangChain, allowing for easy querying and management of documents.

**🤖 Generative Model:**

OpenAI API,

**Model:** GPT-3 or GPT-4

**Access:**   Use the OpenAI API with your API key for the generative component.

Prompt Engineering,

**Strategy:**   Design prompts that effectively utilize the retrieved information to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.
   
**🛠️ Workflow**

Query Handling,

**Step:** Upon receiving a query, use LangChain to first retrieve relevant documents or information.

Contextual Generation,

**Step:** Input the retrieved information into the generative model via the OpenAI API, guiding the model’s output to ensure accurate and relevant responses.

Response Generation,

**Outcome:**   The system produces a response that blends the retrieved information with the generative model's capabilities.

**🔍 Implementation Details**

**📦 Setting Up LangChain and OpenAI API**

	**LangChain Installation:**   Install LangChain and any necessary dependencies.

  	-	pip install langchain

	OpenAI API Key,

**Setup:** Configure your OpenAI API key in your environment or directly in your code to access OpenAI models.

**🏗️ Building the RAG Pipeline**

**Document Retrieval:**

o	Index your documents using a retrieval system.

o	Use LangChain to integrate and query this system.

**Generative Response:**

o	Use the retrieved documents to craft prompts.

o	Send these prompts to the OpenAI API and get the generated response.

**Handling Responses:**

o	Process and format the response as needed for your application.

**Feedback:**
